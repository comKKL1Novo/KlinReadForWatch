/**
 * One imported book on the shelf.

 * and reads content on demand. That keeps the database tiny and means we hold no
 * copy of the user's files.
 *
 * Cover art is the one exception. It is extracted once at import time and cached
 * as a small file, because re-parsing an EPUB cover on every shelf scroll would
 * be far too slow — and on a watch, far too expensive.
