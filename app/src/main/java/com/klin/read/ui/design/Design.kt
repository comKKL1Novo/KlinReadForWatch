/**
 * Semantic colour names, resolved from the Material 3 scheme.
 *
 * This used to be a standalone monochrome palette with its own hardcoded
 * light/dark hex values, which meant the watch carried a second colour system in
 * parallel with Material 3 — the exact anti-pattern the design guidance calls out
 * ("use Material3 tokens, not hardcoded values"). Every colour below is now a
 * role from [MaterialTheme.colorScheme], so:
 *
 *   - there is one source of truth for colour,
 *   - dark mode and dynamic colour work without a second set of constants,
 *   - a theme change cannot leave one screen behind.
 *
 * The property names are kept because they read well at the call site and are
 * used across every screen; only their backing changes.
