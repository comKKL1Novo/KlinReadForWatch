/**
 * Contrast regression tests for the reading surfaces.
 *
 * These exist because the previous values were picked by eye and all three themes
 * fell below 4.5:1 for `secondary`, which is used for real content (chapter-end
 * prompts, reader labels, search placeholders) rather than decoration. A colour is
 * exactly the kind of value that regresses silently: the code still compiles, the
 * screen still renders, and the text is merely hard to read.
 *
 * The tests work on raw ARGB longs rather than `Color` because `Color`'s
 * constructor lives in the Android Compose artifact, which is not on this
 * project's unit-test classpath. An earlier version of this file used `Color` and
 * failed to load at all -- the lesson being that a contrast test which cannot run
 * is worse than none, because it looks like coverage.
 *
 * WCAG 2.1 AA for body text is 4.5:1; for non-text elements such as the hairline
 * divider it is 3:1.
